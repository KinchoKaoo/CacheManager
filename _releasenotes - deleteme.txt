REMOVED Binary Serialization
For the same reason it'll be obsolete in NET50 https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/dotnet/fundamentals/syslib-diagnostics/syslib0011
Was never a good option anyways.

REMOVED Performance Counters - was never working with distributed cache reliably, and never will be. Use Redis metrics if you need that.
REMOVED 2 overloads of WithMicrosoftLogging which either don't work with latest frameworks or would cause more confusion.
        Just use the DI as intended and create a logger factory with providers and use the one option available.

TODO: use Enym.Memcached2 beta package for netstandard2.1 and net50 targeting.
    There are breaking changes which requires slight rewrites and I have no way to test it anyways -> up-for-graps?
